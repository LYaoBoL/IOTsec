# Firmware:
version:DI_8300-16.07.26A1

# Description:
In the system dangerous function of the upgrade_filter_asp function, parameters are passed through the GET request mode for the path variable, resulting in command injection vulnerabilities due to careless concerns.
# Analyse:
Obtain the path parameter and check whether the first seven characters are "http://". If yes, concatenate the command and run the system function without filtering the following characters.
